## This lesson covers

* What are modules for
* A simple module
* Scope
* Require

Modules are used to package up code in to something shareable and reusable. They are very easy to write but are used pretty much everywhere. You'll be writing almost all of you code in modules from now on. So they're a good thing learn.

Put simply, they keep your code separate from the rest of the application. The only thing they contribute to the application is what you choose to ***export***. This will force you to write things in a nice ***encapsulated*** way.

## A simple module

Open the starter code and have a look in the app.js file.
