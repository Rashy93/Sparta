### Data types

In the previous section we put a number in to a variable to keep track of it. But numbers aren't the only things we can use. Computers understand different 'Types' of 'Thing' that we can use. These are the ones available in javascript: 

#### Strings 

These are simple text and are shown by speech marks.

```javascript
var myvariable = 'hello';
``` 

or with double quotes 

```javascript
var myvariable = "hello";
```

#### Numbers

Just numbers. Without speech marks 

```javascript
var myvariable = 5;
```

#### Booleans 

Used for controlling the flow of your programme and handling logic

```javascript
var myvariable = true;
var myvariable = false;
```

#### Arrays

An ordered list or collection of any of the other data types. 

```javascript
var myarray = [5,6,7,"a","b"]
```

#### Objects

Another type of collection. ( covered later )
